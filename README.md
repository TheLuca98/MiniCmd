MiniCmd is a command framework for Bukkit that allows plugin developers to implmenent commands into their plugins
dynamically, without having to register them in the `plugin.yml` file. The framework uses Bukkit's command preprocess
events to handle command executions without having to use Bukkit internals.

The user guide and a few examples can be found in the **Wiki**.
